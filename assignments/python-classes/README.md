# 📘 Assignment: Python Classes

## 🎯 Objective

In this assignment, students learn how to create and use classes in Python to model real-world objects. They will define attributes, write instance methods, and update object state.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Define a Simple Class

#### Description
Create a class named `Car` with core attributes and a method that displays the object information.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Define a class `Car` with `make`, `model`, and `year` attributes
- Implement a method `display_info()` that prints the car details in a readable format
- Create at least one `Car` instance and call `display_info()`


### 🛠️ Add Methods and Interactions

#### Description
Expand the `Car` class by adding mileage tracking and methods to update and display mileage.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Add a `mileage` attribute with a default value of `0`
- Implement `update_mileage(new_mileage)` to update the stored mileage
- Implement `display_mileage()` to print the current mileage
- Demonstrate updating and displaying mileage for a `Car` instance
